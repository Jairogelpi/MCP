# MCP Financial Gateway - One Pager

## The Industry Standard for Agentic Economy
The **MCP Financial Gateway** is the first enterprise-grade infrastructure designed to govern, audit, and settle economic transactions performed by AI Agents.

### Why Now?
AI Agents are moving from "chat" to "action". When agents spend money, execute trades, or provision resources, you need **Ledger-Grade Control**, not just a proxy.

### Key Features
1.  **Immutable Audit**: Every tool call is signed, hashed, and chained.
2.  **Budget Enforcer**: Hard/Soft limits per tenant, agent, or model.
3.  **Universal Compatibility**: Works with any MCP-compliant LLM or Tool.
4.  **Enterprise Ready**: SOC2/GDPR compliant, RBAC, and Disaster Recovery built-in.

### ROI
- **Reduce Risk**: Prevent runaway agent spending.
- **Compliance**: Instant audit trails for regulators.
- **Monetization**: Turn AI tools into billable assets.
