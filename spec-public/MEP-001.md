# MEP-001: Model Context Protocol Economic Extension

**Version**: 0.1.0
**Status**: Draft

## Introduction
MEP-001 defines a set of extensions to the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to enable financial observability, budget enforcement, and immutable audit logs (receipts) for tool execution.

## 1. Action Envelope
All requests and responses SHOULD be wrapped in an `ActionEnvelope` to provide common metadata and a unique correlation ID.

### Required Meta Fields
- `id`: UUID v4 or KSUID.
- `tenant_id`: Unique identifier for the billing entity.
- `targetServer`: The name of the upstream MCP server.
- `timestamp`: Unix timestamp in milliseconds.

## 2. Economic Metadata
Requests MAY include `budget_scopes` to define the hierarchy of limits to check (e.g., `["tenant:acme", "project:alpha"]`).

## 3. Semantics
- **Reservation**: A pre-flight check that locks a estimated maximum cost against a budget.
- **Settlement**: An post-flight update that records the actual cost (based on tokens/units) and releases any remainder of the reservation.

## 4. Compatibility
Implementations MUST preserve unknown fields in the `meta` object to ensure forward compatibility and round-trip transparency.
